>##### File descriptions
>- The initial, pre-curation, consensus sequence is in the file labeled `*_con.fa`. This file should be used as the starting point for the manual curation process.
>- The initial seed alignment is located in the file labeled `GENUS_SPECIES_TEID.stk`.
>- The trimmed multiple sequence alignment used to generate the final consensus sequence is located in the file `*_elements_aligned.fa`
>- The final seed alignment is located in the file labeled `TE-NUM_SPECIES.stk`.
>- The final curated consensus sequence is in the file labeled `TE-NUM_SPECIES.fasta`.
>- The completed notebook is also provided both as a python notebook file (`*.ipynb`) and as a PDF.

#### Important
For Step 2.1 in the notebook: Please use the file `copia_con.fa` as the input repeat library FASTA file for this example and use `rnd-3_family-103` for the SeqID field.
