#### This folder contains six example _ColabCuraTE_ notebooks which show the curation process for six different transposon families. The starting sequences for examples 1-5 were identified by _RepeatModeler2_, while the starting sequence for the sixth example was identified by _HiTE_.

1. [Curation of a _copia_ Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retrotransposon from the fruit fly _Drosophila melanogaster_](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Ellison-Lab/ColabCuraTE/blob/main/examples/ColabCuraTE_copia.ipynb)
2. [Curation of a _gypsy_ Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retrotransposon from the snake _Bungarus multicinctus_](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Ellison-Lab/ColabCuraTE/blob/main/examples/ColabCuraTE_gypsy.ipynb)
3. [Curation of a _SINE_ non-LTR retrotransposon from the snake _Bungarus multicinctus_](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Ellison-Lab/ColabCuraTE/blob/main/examples/ColabCuraTE_sine.ipynb)
4. [Curation of a _LINE_ non-LTR retrotransposon from the snake _Bungarus multicinctus_]()
5. [Curation of a _hAT_ DNA transposon from the rice plant _Oryza sativa_]()
6. [Curation of the _297_ LTR retrotransposon from the fruit fly _Drosophila melanogaster_]()

>The FASTA files (`*.fa`) in this folder contain the initial, pre-curation, consensus sequence for each TE which should be used as the starting point for the manual curation process.
