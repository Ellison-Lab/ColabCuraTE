        "_ColabCuraTE_ relies on a pre-existing **repeat library** as input, typically generated by _de novo_ TE discovery tools such as **RepeatModeler2**. Running such tools on a whole-genome assembly is extremely computationally intensive and thus not feasible within the Google Colab environment. Below we provide details on how to use the **Galaxy web server** as a complementary resource to run _RepeatModeler2_ for generating a repeat library.\n",

        "    - Leave other settings as default unless you have specific options.\n",
